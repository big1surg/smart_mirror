# smart_mirror
pulled from smart mirror and added modules 

https://github.com/HackerShackOfficial/Smart-Mirror

used their layout and broke it into modules with calendar, compliments, and news
most of the code is theirs and i do not take credit for their work

to setup follow their instructions
for google api follow the python quickstart page and make sure you add it to the develope google page so that it is allowed
